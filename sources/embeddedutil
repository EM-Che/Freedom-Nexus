From google summer of code updated March 3, 2015. Added March 15, 2015.
http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/google-code-in-2014-wrap-up-with-haiku.html
introducing 13 to 17 year old students to working in open source communities.

 2014 was the fifth year for Google Code-in (GCI) and also Haikuâ€™s fifth year participating. 
 This was the first year where we offered beginner tasks designed to give students an easy way to get started. 
 These tasks introduced students to booting and using Haiku, compiling Haiku, and using Haikuporter to build a package
 from a recipe file.

149 students completed at least one task with us this year and 
36 students completed at least three tasks with us to earn a GCI t-shirt. 
Six students completed over 20 tasks each in a bid to become grand prize winners. 
Each mentoring organization selected two grand prize winners and three finalists. 
Our finalists were Augustin Cavalier, Markus Himmel and Chirayu Desai. 
(Chirayu was also a GCI 2013 winner with RTEMS.) Our winners were Josef Gajdusek and Puck Meerburg.

After getting started with beginner tasks, 
many students moved on to tasks which added improvements to Haiku or fixed bugs. 
Students contributed to HaikuWeather, SuperFreeCell, BookmarkConvert, and our CatKey editor. 
Many HaikuPorter recipes were added and updated, making it easier 
to bring existing software into Haiku. Several tickets were resolved
, new GUI controls were created, new screensavers were added, and several apps were updated to make use of 
Layout Manager. 

In total, students completed a staggering 435 tasks for Haiku during the
summer of code 2014. contest?
